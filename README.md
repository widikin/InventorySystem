Inventory System in C#


This inventory system is meant for managing inventory for supplies required for brewing beers, wine and so forth.
It uses the ingredients' product serial number to identify the product for easy addition and subtraction from the inventory.
Same products with different serial numbers, bought from different retailers can be linked and specified to be the same product.

TODO: A lot. Still under heavy development.
Later to be converted to a ASP.net web application.
